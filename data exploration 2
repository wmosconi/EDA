## Are there any differences between the genders, ethnicities and parental level of education with respect to their performances in exams?

##It seems that females are more successful at reading and writing whereas males are more successful at math. The t-tests justify that the differences are statistically significant.

##There are some significant differences between some groups like master's degree and high school.

##2. Are there any differences between the lunch types with respect to their performances in exams? If there are, how do you explain this?

student_df.groupby("lunch").mean()[["math score", "reading score", "writing score"]]

ttest_ind(student_df[student_df.lunch == "free/reduced"][["math score", "reading score", "writing score"]],
          student_df[student_df.lunch == "standard"][["math score", "reading score", "writing score"]])
          
##Yes, students who have standard lunch are more successful than the others.

## 3. Does the test preparation course seem to have an effect on the exam performances?

student_df.groupby("test preparation course").mean()[["math score", "reading score", "writing score"]]

ttest_ind(student_df[student_df["test preparation course"] == "completed"][["math score", "reading score", "writing score"]],
          student_df[student_df["test preparation course"] == "none"][["math score", "reading score", "writing score"]])
          
## Yes, those who completed the test preparation course are more successfull than the others.

## 4. Which two exam scores are correlated the most with each other?

student_df[["math score", "reading score", "writing score"]].corr()
